EDEINOS
Cosm: Living Land
Natives of the Living Land, edeinos are lizard-
like humanoids who venerate a Goddess of Life
and celebrate survival against all odds. After the
invasion of Core Earth by the Reality Raiders,
many edeinos have journeyed beyond their cosm
and joined the fight against the High Lords. Most
are eager for new experiences, seeing each day as
another test of survival.
Edeinos characters may take any of the Perks
below.
Bluespine
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, At least one add in survival
A steady diet of deeproot (see page 30) causesadaptive mutations in the edeinos. A bright blue
tinge appears along the spine, gills grow in the
neck, and webbing stretches between the fingers
and toes. The hero can now breathe and move his
normal speed while underwater, and “run“ 2× his
Dexterity meters while submerged.
Bone Marked
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, may not have Chameleon
Skin or Stone Skin
A rare few albino edeinos are born in the Living
Land. Their eyes are dark red in color and their
scales are snowy white. Their unusual scales are
more resistant to damage. Chosen are born among
the Ghost Clan more often than any other.
It is believed that these edeinos have been
cursed by the Goddess to endure a greater share
of challenges for survival. They are generally
shunned by edeinos society. The character gains
+1 Toughness and Armor +2 from his scaly hide.
However, he suffers the Outsider penalty even
among other edeinos.
Farwalker
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, Charisma 8+, may not be Bone
Marked
Some edeinos are naturally gifted diplomats,
possessing a certain gravitas that works in
harmony with the natural depth of a profound
spiritual connection. These edeinos are prized by
many tribes and clans as envoys, advisers, and
peacemakers, earning the name “farwalkers“ in
recognition of their many journeys beyond the
tribal lands. Even among other races, farwalkers
can more easily earn trust and win respect. A
character with the Farwalker Perk no longer suffers
the Outsider penalty and persuasion becomes a
Favored skill.
Razor Scales
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Bone Marked or Stone Skin
Sharpened bone spurs or scales cover the
edeinos’ body. These natural weapons may have
been provided by nature, miracles, or meticulous
training and sharpening. Any unarmed combat
attacker suffers their own Strength +1 damage upon
striking the edeinos.
Sata Eater
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, at least two adds in survival
Sata flowers are deadly poison to most species.
They aren’t good for edeinos either, but those
who build a tolerance for them with steady
consumption become terrifying berserkers. Once
per act the character may use a simple action to
eat a petal and activate the flower’s effects. For
one minute (six rounds) the edeinos ignores Shock
from any source. After the drug has run its course
the character is KO’ed. Wounds cause penalties
and can KO the character normally.
Skin Shifter
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Chameleon Skin, may not have Bone
Marked or Stone Skin
Edeinos with this gift are blessed with supple skin
that changes color so quickly he fades completely
into the jungle around him. Ranged attacks against
a skin shifter suffer a −2 penalty, or –4 when
he’s surrounded jungle or thick undergrowth. If
he remains still he becomes totally invisible, so
attempts to find or attack him suffer a –6 penalty.
Wearing armor or carrying equipment ruins the
chameleon effect. Carrying a small enough object
may only reduce the skin’s effectiveness, lowering
the penalty to others by two points (GM’s call).
FAITH
Cosm: Living Land
Faith exists in many cosms, but it’s especially
strong in the Living Land. Those who are blessed
by Lanala, the patron deity of the realm, have an
aura of health and vitality around them, making
the blessed ones seem more virile and hearty. These
gifts are only available to denizens of the Living
Land, but aren’t limited to those who worship Keta
Kalles (see page 80).
Blessed Weapon
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Spirit 8+, at least one add in faith
A single weapon belonging to the character is
infused with divine power by the Goddess of Life.
The blessed weapon gains a +1 damage bonus when
wielded by the character, or a +2 damage bonus
when used against gospog and other creatures of
supernatural evil. The weapon is considered holy.
15The weapon must be Tech 7 or lower, and if it is
ever lost or destroyed, the character may dedicate
another weapon (using the same restriction) after a
day of prayer.
Chosen of Lanala
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Spirit 10+, at least one add in faith
The Storm Knight has laid eyes upon the edeinos
goddess of life and been changed by the experience.
A “chosen“ sometimes awakens with the half-
remembered words of the goddess still in her ears,
and her body begins to change to accommodate
Lanala’s will. The character now counts as an
edeinos for purposes of Perk prerequisites.
Fortified by Faith
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: At least one add in faith
Strong belief in righteousness or a rewarding
afterlife helps the devotee resist coercion and
threats of danger. When the character must test
for Fear she may use her faith in place of Spirit or
willpower.
Gotak (Priest of Death)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, one or more adds in faith,
may not take Optant or Perks related to other
religions
In Keta Kalles’s creed, gotaks are priests tasked
with dealing with death and dead things. It’s an
unpopular but necessary calling that has grown in
scope as Baruk Kaah’s endless war takes the edeinos
deeper into the dead places of the cosmverse—and
created the need for so many more funerals. Many
gotaks have defected to Thrakmoss (see page 84)
and now directly serve Rec Stalek, but some remain
true to Lanala and their original calling.
A newly anointed priest selects two miracles from
the Gotak list (see page 21), plus the ward enemy
miracle available to all faithful. The Miracles Perk
may be purchased for more miracles, and does
grant access to the broader Keta Kalles Miracle List
found in Torg Eternity.
Optant (Priest of Life)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Edeinos, one or more adds in faith,
may not take Gotak or Perks related to other
religions
16
This Perk represents a character’s devotion to the
Way of Lanala. Priests who serve the tribe first and
seek to preserve life are called optants. Optants
select two miracles from the Optant list (see page
21), plus the shape plant and ward enemy miracles.
The Miracles Perk may be purchased for more
miracles, and does grant access to the broader Keta
Kalles Miracle List found in Torg Eternity.
Spirit of Takta Ker
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Beta Clearance, Spirit 8+
The character’s Spirit attribute increases +1.
V ehemence
• Prereqs: Beta Clearance, Spirit 10+
Invoke a miracle with a Casting Time of 1 minute
or less in a single round. The DN of the miracle
increases by +6 when so accelerated.
SAVAGERY
Cosm: Living Land
The Living Land exemplifies the idea of primitive
adventure. Characters who journey through the
cosm often learn to embrace the nature of such a
place.
Animal Companion (All Types)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: None
This Perk grants the hero a faithful creature as a
companion. Any type of creature can follow basic
commands, such as attacking a foe it’s pointed at,
protecting a person or area, or going to or waiting
at a familiar place the character has marked for it.
The player controls the companion. The Game
Master should only take over if the pet becomes
confused, abused, or is off on its own. The beast
does not have Possibilities of its own, but the
character can spend his Possibilities (and Destiny
cards) for the creature even if they are separated.
If the companion is Defeated, it should be
considered Incapacitated instead of slain. It returns
at the start of the next act. If it’s truly and undeniably
killed, the character must visit the Living Land and
spend several nights in the jungle to bond with a
new companion.Larger numbers of edeinos are turning against those who remain loyal to Baruk Kaah.
Each different type of companion counts as
a different Perk, so a Storm Knight may have
different types of companions, but not more than
one of the same type.
Animal Companion (Raptor)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Mind 8+
Sometimes called “Velociraptors“ even though
fossil experts note that these specimens are closer to
deinonychus in size, but those same experts admit
neither name is truly correct since the raptors of
the Living Land have no feathers. These predatory
dinosaurs are slightly smaller than humans. The
general shape and the large sickle claw on each
foot fits the popular image of the beasts, so the
name has stuck.
Raptors are extremely common among the
various edeinos tribes. They use the beasts to track
or harass prey, as trackers, or as a sacrificial decoy
if the hunt goes badly enough.
Raptor
Attributes: Charisma 5, Dexterity 10, Mind 5,
Spirit 8, Strength 9
Skills: Dodge 11, find 7, intimidation 9, maneuver
11, stealth 11, trick 8, unarmed combat 11
Move: 12; Tough: 10 (1); Shock: 8; Wounds: 2
Perks: —
Possibilities: Never
Special Abilities:
• Armor: Scaly hide +1.
• Bite/Claws: Strength +2 (11).
Animal Companion (Pterodactyl)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Spirit 8+
Fearsome, winged reptiles of prey. The
pterodactyls represented here have a wingspan
similar to a large bird of prey, just under two
meters from tip to tip. A pterodactyl is just small
enough to perch (uncomfortably) on a person’s
shoulders or arm.
17Pterodactyls are extremely adept at hunting
smaller prey, or using maneuver to dive and distract
their master’s foes.
P terodactyl
Attributes: Charisma 6, Dexterity 12, Mind 5,
Spirit 8, Strength 6
Skills: Dodge 13, find 9, intimidation 9, maneuver
13, survival 7, unarmed combat 13
Move: 8; Tough: 6; Shock: 8; Wounds: 2
Perks: —
Possibilities: Never
Special Abilities:
• Bite/Claws: Strength +1 (7).
• Flight: Speed 16 in the air.
Animal Companion (Sabre-Tooth Tiger)
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Beta Clearance, Animal Companion
(Sabre-Tooth Cat)
Those lucky enough to earn the loyalty of a saber-
tooth cat may discover a similar affinity for the
larger and more dangerous breed—or that their
existing companion was actually a very young tiger
all along and it has now grown to its full stature!
These cats are large and strong enough for a
person to ride, although it’s ill-advised for anyone
but the beast’s master to try. The tiger replaces the
sabre-tooth cat, and represents an upgrade rather
than an extra companion.
Sabre-Tooth Tiger
Attributes: Charisma 7, Dexterity 10, Mind 5,
Spirit 8, Strength 12
Skills: Dodge 14, find 8, intimidation 10, maneuver
12, stealth 14, survival 8, unarmed combat 13
Move: 14; Tough: 12; Shock: 8; Wounds: 3
Perks: —
Possibilities: Never
Special Abilities:
• Bite/Claws: Strength +2 (14).
Beast Affinity
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Beast Rider
When mounted on any creature, the rider may
divert Wounds suffered from an attack to the
beast instead. Note that this ignores the creature’s
Toughness, it simply takes the Wounds. Conversely,
18
reality-rated riders may attempt to soak damage
done to their mounts.
Beast Tamer
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Beta Clearance, Beast Rider
If a creature is strong enough to support the
character’s weight (Strength 12+) then it can be
ridden—at least for a time. The hero must be close
enough to climb atop the creature, and then tests
beast riding against its Spirit. On a success the rider
manages to hold on until the end of the creature’s
next turn. It may not attack him during its turn,
and if it moves the rider comes along.
On a Good Success the rider stays perched until
the beast can buck him off. It moves normally but
must use its action to test Strength or maneuver in
a contest against the character’s beast riding until
a success dismounts the rider. On an Outstanding
Success the character may use the creature as though
it were a trained mount—including directing its
attacks—for the remainder of the scene.
Fast Healing
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Beta Clearance
Wounds heal quickly in the Living Land, and
even more so for this hero. The character may test
for healing after every scene in addition to the tests
granted for normal healing times. Medicine and
other assistance has no effect on these extra tests.
Ferocious
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Beta Clearance, at least three adds in
melee weapons or unarmed combat
This character remains wild and fierce even in
the most civilized environs. Once per scene the
character gains +1BD of damage if making an All-
Out Attack. This damage stacks with the Law of
Savagery, if it’s in effect.
Hardy
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Strength 8+
Life in the harsh and desperate wilderness of the
Living Land has some benefits—for those who
survive. The character’s Toughness increases by +1,
and this increase does stack with Toughness from
other sources.
Jungle Master
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: At least one add in survival
This character has mastered the art of thriving
beyond the borders of civilization. The hero ignores
any penalties to movement from forest or jungle
terrain, and survival and tracking are Favored skills
in either environment.
Scarred
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereq: Hardy
The character bears the reminders of several close
calls, improving her physique and her ability to
survive other threats of the Possibility Wars. The
character’s Wound limit increases by +1.

Savage Strength
Cosm: Living Land
• Prereqs: Beta Clearance, Strength 10+
Fighting for survival every day has tempered the
character’s body with muscle and fury. Increase
Strength by +1.
Vine Master
• Prereqs: At least one add in survival
In any environment with vines, ropes, or similar
hanging vegetation the character may climb
Dexterity meters each round or swing 3× Dexterity
meters (as a run) to any position at the same
elevation or lower. Any tests to climb in such
situations count as Favored.
PROWESS
Cosms: Any
The Living Land exemplifies the idea of primitive
adventure, and these Perks reflect that fact.
Poison Tolerance
Cosms: Any
• Prereqs: None
Either through a natural resistance or carefully
cultivated practice the character shrugs off all but
the most deadly toxins. She makes a Strength test
immediately when affected by Poison (see Torg
Eternity), and if the test succeeds the poison is
eliminated without further effect. All tests to resist
or end the effects of a Poison count as Favored.
Smasher
Cosms: Any
• Prereqs: Strength 8+, at least one add in melee
weapons
The character is well practiced at hitting things
with big, heavy sticks. He ignores the Unwieldy
property on weapons. If used two-handed, any
Unwieldy weapon that doesn’t already have the
Stagger property gains it.
Sprinter
Cosms: Any
• Prereq: Dexterity 8+
When the character uses an action to run he moves
4× Dexterity meters. Testing Dexterity to gain steps
in a foot chase (see Torg Eternity) is Favored.
SOCIAL
Cosms: Any
Social interactions tend to be straightforward
in the low axiom of the Living Land. A strong
personality backed by a strong arm can accomplish
much.
Chest Beating
Cosms: Any
• Prereq: Strength 8+, one or more adds in
intimidation
When intimidation is an Approved Action, the
hero ignores up to eight points of Multi-Target
penalties so long as all the targets have a Social
Axiom of eight or lower. Animals always count for
this purpose, regardless of their cosm’s axiom.
Primitive Allure
Cosms: Any
• Prereq: Charisma 8+, one or more adds in
persuasion
Something about the character draws attention,
especially from those more in touch with their
primal nature. Persuasion and beast riding become
Favored against anyone with a Social Axiom
of eight or less. Animals always count for this
purpose, regardless of their cosm’s axiom. In
addition, the character may use a Simple Action
and pick a single target with the same restriction.
The persuasion skill (or beast riding if the target is
an animal) may be used as a defense against that
target’s attacks until the character’s next turn.
