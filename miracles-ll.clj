After the supplicant’s heartfelt prayers are
answered, the ground rends open and hot ash
billows into the air. The cloud spreads out from
the invoker’s position, but doesn’t move if he does.
Everyone inside the effect suffers 1 Shock each
round for the duration unless they don’t need to
breathe or have special protection. A filter mask or
a cloth soaked in water can keep the ash at bay.
Most heroes can fashion something appropriate
with an action and a survival test. The thick cloud
creates a −4 Darkness penalty for all attacks against
targets within it.
Success Levels:
• Good: The invoker no longer suffers Shock
each round from the cloud.
20• Outstanding: As a Good result, and the
invoker doesn’t suffer the cloud’s Darkness
penalty to attacks.

Sharp and spiky spurs grow from the target’s very
bones. The target must have a skeleton, otherwise
this miracle automatically fails. The process and
effect is excruciating, dealing 2 Shock to the target
each round. The spikes make a nasty weapon,
however, allowing the target to deal Strength +2
damage as a Bite/Claws attack and granting a +2
bonus to defenses against Grapples.
21Gotaks of Rec Stalek often employ bone blades
on their creations since the drawbacks don’t harm
most undead.
Success Levels:

bonus to defenses against Grapples.
• Outstanding: As a Good result and the
duration increases to one minute.

Gouts of divine flame pour from the believer’s
mouth, burning away sin and everything else! The
flames deal 16 damage to a Medium Blast, which
means adjacent allies and even the invoker herself
may be affected. The damage applies to each
target’s lowest Armor value, unless protected by
full coverage.
Success Levels:

Some deities bask in toxins and venom, and pass
those gifts on to their faithful. This miracle may
coat a weapon with dangerous poison, or be aimed
at a foe to directly poison him. The base effect of
the poison is to make the target Very Stymied, and
it stops affecting any hit target immediately when
the miracle’s duration ends.
Success Levels:
• Good: The poison also deals 1 Shock each
round it affects a target.
• Outstanding: The poison also deals 2 Shock
each round it affects a target.

Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Cure poison is a particularly popular and useful
miracle in the Living Land, since the infinite
variety of the life found there sports an equally
varied number of lethal venoms. Several poisonous
dinosaurs have been discovered, multitudes of
toxic plants (some carnivorous) have been found,
and even a number of mammals are venomous.
This miracle quickly flushes any toxins out of the
target’s system. On a success the target makes a
Strength test as if the full minute of the poison’s
effects had expired. Any of the toxin’s modifiers for
the test remain in place. If the test fails, the poison
continues to affect the target normally.
Success Levels:
• Good: The poison ends its duration
immediately without requiring a Strength test
from the target. Conditions caused by the
poison linger normally.
• Outstanding: The poison ends its duration
immediately without requiring a Strength test
from the target and any conditions caused
by the poison are removed. This includes
conditions like Stymied and Vulnerable, but
also the KO’ed condition.

The fury of the earth can be terrifying to behold
when unleashed. This miracle forces the ground to
shake, quiver, and tear itself apart. Everyone within
a Large Blast suffers 15 damage +1BD each round
they remain within the affected area. Objects fixed
to the ground (such as buildings) suffer 30 damage
+2BD each round instead.
Success Levels:

everything within 100 meters of the targeted
epicenter.
• Outstanding: The area of effect increases
to affect everything within 500 meters of the

A corona of bright
flames surrounds the
invoker and wards off
foes. Once successfully
activated all attacks against
the character suffer a −2
penalty. In addition, anyone
who grapples or hits the
character with an unarmed
attack suffers 14 damage.
Likewise the invoker’s own
unarmed attacks deal at least 14
damage thanks to the writhing
flames.

flames grow stronger, increasing the
damage they deal to 16.

Vegetation in the area squirms to life and wraps
around limbs or forms a net. The vines attack all
targets within a Large Blast, and anyone affected
may not run for the duration. If this miracle is cast
during a chase, targets who can’t run may not test
to gain Steps.
Special: Within the Living Land, this miracle may
be attempted without the Miracles Perk by jakatts
so long as the faith prerequisite is met.
Success Levels:

for the duration.

One of the most potent miracles
known to exist in the Living Land,
invocation directly petitions Lanala
for divine intervention. The
miracle worker utters profound prayers and opens
both hands toward the sky.
If the test succeeds an Avatar of Lanala (page 80)
appears on the scene and may grant a boon to the
petitioner. Her powers are vast, but her mood is
unpredictable. She might summon a huge storm or
earthquake, transport the entire group to a distant
location, or disconnect any “dead things“ within
her sight. Any request inappropriate to her nature
(for example, asking her to create an undead being)
causes the miracle to fail.
Lanala acts as she sees fit, battling abominations
or judging those who have abused power in
her name—including the Storm Knights. She
wanders away after 30 seconds (three rounds)
unless something in the area keeps her attention.
Summoning Lanala too often (usually more than
once per game year, GM’s call) or for purposes that
anger her draw her direct wrath.
Special: Within the Living Land, this miracle may
be attempted without the Miracles Perk by jakatts
if the faith prerequisite is met.
Success Levels:
• Good: The invoker isn’t affected by Lanala’s
Awe special ability.
• Outstanding: The invoker isn’t affected by
Lanala’s Awe special ability. Lanala acts to
grant a request within her nature and power,
regardless of her mood.

Mend corpse stitches together rotting flesh and
shattered bones, but it only works on a subject that’s
already dead—or undead. It’s extremely useful
for keeping Gospog and other undead creatures
functional and fighting. Successfully invoking this

restores a KO’ed corpse where it fell, though it still
has any Wounds it suffered.
Success Levels:
• Good: Restores two Wounds, or two different
fallen undead within range.
• Outstanding: Restores three Wounds, or
three different fallen undead within range.

This miracle halts the decay of dead flesh on a
single human-sized body. The most common use
is to protect corpses until proper funerary customs
can be observed, otherwise difficult in a land where
a corpse decays to bare bones in less than a day.
It’s also useful for preserving food which might
otherwise spoil or rot too quickly.
Success Levels:
• Good: The duration extends one week.

and touches the subject. The subject heals one
Wound each round, until he has only one Wound.

temporary injury, eliminated once any Wounds
heal.

DN: Target’s willpower or Spirit plus any Size
Modifier
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
The invoker must calmly approach a beast and pray
for acceptance. The DN is the creature’s willpower
or Spirit. Larger animals are more difficult to affect
so any Size modifier is added to the DN instead of
the attack. If the invocation succeeds, the creature
accepts the caster as a rider for the duration and
obeys commands to move or attack. It only obeys
so long as the rider is mounted, however. If the
beast suffers any damage the duration ends.
Success Levels:
• Good: The duration increases to one minute.
• Outstanding: The duration increases to a full
scene.

This miracle’s power allows the caster to shape
dead bones as if they were made of clay, a process
known as boneforging.
The miracle worker may create weapons, armor,
or other items from the bones of the dead, assuming
there’s enough bone available to create the item—
GM’s call. A single average-size skeleton has
enough bone to create three clubs or two spears.
Armor requires two skeletons or larger dinosaur
bones.
The DN is 8 for a simple object the invoker can
hold in his hands. More complex objects are crafted
using the item’s Value as the DN, with a minimum
DN of 8. For example, creating a boneforged spear
is DN 10.
Success Levels:
• Good: Up to two matching items are created,
if there’s enough bone for each.
• Outstanding: Up to three matching items are
created, if enough bone is present for all three.

This miracle is known to most jakatts in the Living
Land. Shape plant induces flora (living or dead) to
bend, twist, or weave together to create various
simple items. The ubiquitous hrockt plant is the
most common subject of this miracle: light, fast-
growing, and sturdy enough to retain a sharp point
after the shaping has done its work.
The invoker may create weapons, armor, or other
items from nearby vegetation, assuming there’s
enough plant matter available to create the item—
GM’s call. This miracle affects only stationary and
non-sentient plants. It doesn’t affect carnivorous
plants or Living Land gospog.
The DN is 8 for a simple object the invoker can
hold in his hands. More complex objects are crafted
using the item’s Value as the DN, with a minimum
DN of 8. For example, creating a hrockt-shoot spear
uses the minimum DN 8, but hrockt-root armor is
DN 13 to shape.
Special: Within the Living Land, this miracle may
be attempted without the Miracles Perk by jakatts
so long as the faith prerequisite is met.
Success Levels:
• Good: Up to two matching items are created,
if there’s enough material for each.
• Outstanding: Up to three matching items are
created, if enough material is present for all
three.

Touch of time invokes the same accelerated rot and
decay that courses through the Living Land. This
miracle may only target lifeless objects, but this

This miracle requires two spears. The character
may throw a single spear per turn, and it is replaced
by an identical one. If both spears are thrown in
