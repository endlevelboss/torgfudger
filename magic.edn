  "This spell allows the caster to possess and take
limited control a normal animal of Small size or
smaller she can see (magical animals and creatures
like animal companions are immune). The mage
can influence where the animal goes and looks,
but cannot force the animal to make attacks or
interaction attacks, or otherwise endanger itself.
The spellcaster can use the animal’s senses
but makes tests on Mind-based skills to gather
information using his own skill values. The caster
may not normally act or sense his own body while
possessing an animal, but may split his attention
to do both by taking a Multi-Action penalty. If the
animal gets beyond 1 kilometer, the spell ends.
Success Levels:

are Favored.

  "Prerequisite: Beta Clearance, one of birdswarm,
messenger hawk, or animal’s eyes
This spell may be cast over a vast distance, but the
effect cannot cross reality boundaries, and if this
spell is contradictory, it is limited to 1,000 meters
as normal.
The caster chooses an earthly type of animal. This
spell allows the caster to locate a specific creature
or object by looking through the eyes of all animals
of that type in range (even if out of line of sight).
If the target is in a location with those animals,
the animal discovering the subject continues to
monitor the target, and the caster can attempt to
decipher where the target is by making one Heroic
(DN 18) divination test.
While an animal monitors the subject, a black circle
appears on the animal’s right eye, and a Mishap on
the test to locate a living target allows the target to
realize it is being watched.
This spell can only be cast once a day to find a
specific person or object regardless of which
animals are used.
Success Levels:
• Good: Skill tests to search for the subject or
determine its location become Favored.
• Outstanding: As Good and when the caster
figures out where the subject is, he can cast
spells targeting the subject as if standing at
the animal’s location. Damage or interaction
conditions to the animal cause Concentration
tests as normal."}

This spell allows the mage to strike a “bargain”

  "Prerequisite: Beta Clearance, armor spell
  The caster must have a bone, preferably a human
bone (which makes casting this spell Favored). The
caster points the bone forward, to the right, to the
left, then behind and throws it on the ground.
On a success, the bones multiply into a whirling
barrier around the caster that provides +3 armor
with Full Body protection. The bones do not
impair sight, other senses, or any actions including
spellcasting.
If a melee weapons or unarmed combat attack against
the caster misses, the attacker takes 12 damage.
Success Levels
• Good: The skeletal barrier provides +4 armor,
and retributive damage gains +1BD.
• Outstanding:
As Good but the armor

  "Parallel to our physical existence is an immaterial
one, a realm of ghosts and spirits. Some of these
vengeful spirits, under a high enough Magic
Axiom, can physically manifest and appear as
demons. Skilled sorcerers have discovered a means
to replicate this feat, but in the other direction.
When successfully cast, the sorcerer intentionally
separates his spirit from his physical body, and
his body becomes helpless and inert, as if he were
sleeping. The hero’s astral form is transparent,
ethereal, and can fly as fast as he can run. The
character remains connected to his physical body
through a silver cord, and can travel up to one
kilometer away. The spellcaster may instantly
move back into his physical body as a free action.
This also happens if the caster loses Concentration
or if the caster’s astral form or physical body is
subject to an effect like the banish miracle.
The hero can view the physical realm as if he
were physically present but cannot interact
with beings or objects present. However, he can
interact with and be attacked by ghosts, spirits, or
other immaterial entities. Any of his abilities not
connected to physical objects can be used in astral
form, including inherent pulp powers, pulp sorcery
rituals, miracles, or spells. He can also attack using
unarmed combat. These abilities and attacks only
affect immaterial beings. Invoking banish while
in astral form on an already immaterial foe has no
effect.
Attacks that can affect ethereal beings work on the
caster’s spirit for full effect.
Success Levels:
• Good: The character becomes invisible but
can become visible and speak to others in the
physical realm as a simple action. The caster
still cannot touch or otherwise physically
interact with any objects, but can make verbal
interaction attacks.
• Outstanding: As Good and the spellcaster
can travel any distance away (in the same realm
or cosm) from his body, and can travel to that
location instantly (though he must already be
familiar with that location)."}

 "Flesh link is a defensive spell devised by Tharkoldu
scholars. In technodemon fashion, the caster shares
his pain with a single unwilling target. Multi-
Targeting rules cannot be used.
If successful, the target suffers all Shock the caster
suffers, after any mitigating effects such as Occultech
or Soaking. If the target reduces or is otherwise
immune to Shock, those abilities still apply.
Flesh link does not prevent the caster from suffering
any damage, and it inflicts Shock before the caster
takes any Concentration tests.
Success Levels:

 "Elemental bullets allows the acolyte to infuse bullets
in any firearm with elemental energy. This spell can
only be cast on weapons that fire standard bullets
(i.e. no energy, thrown, or missile weapons or special
ammunition). Enchanting heavy weapons (i.e. those
that require heavy weapons to fire) takes a Hard (–4)
penalty. Multiple firearms may be targeted with
Multi-Targeting as normal.
When the acolyte casts this spell, she selects one
form of elemental energy to infuse into the weapons.
As the caster lifts her hand from the firearms they
pulse with the imbued energy. Elemental bullets
count as a magical attack.
The energy options include:
• Cold (Cryo Bullets): Frost can visibly be
seen on the barrel. The weapon is cold to the
touch, and when fired, bolts of ice shoot forth
from the weapon. A target hit by cryo bullets
becomes Stymied and Movement speed drops
by 2 until Stymied wears off.
• Fire (Fire Spitters): The firearm’s barrel
glows red with heat. When this firearm is
fired, the bullets look like bursts of fire. Those
struck by fire spitters may catch on fire (see
Environmental Hazards in Torg Eternity;
Damage 12 each round and Stymied) if
the damage of the bullet is greater than the
target’s total toughness, unless they can pass
a Dexterity (DN 12) test. The fire goes out if
the target suffers no Shock damage from it or
spends an Action to douse the flames.
• Electricity (Shock Rounds): Electrical energy
crackles around the weapon, infusing the
firearm’s bullets with lightning. When fired,
the rounds appear to be bolts of lightning.
Those struck by a weapon enhanced with
shock rounds take 2 Shock.

 "This is an exceptionally risky ancient (and
contradictory) spell, only used by the most desperate
or mad of acolytes. The Tharkoldu are creatures of
magic, and they are bound to it in ways humans and
the Race are not.
The acolyte draws a summoning circle and uses it
to harness a massive amount of magical energy. This
draws the attention of a nearby technodemon or
pulls one into the area if none are present. Shouted
words of power and runes of binding etched into
the air force the Tharkoldu to submit to the scholar’s
will—temporarily.
For the duration of the spell, the technodemon
must do as commanded. If the Tharkoldu is ordered
to do something he’s violently opposed to, such
as harming himself, he may make a contest of
willpower or Spirit against the caster’s apportation to
break free and end the duration. Luckily, demons
generally don’t mind hurting other beings, even
their own allies.
The caster may attempt to summon a specific
Tharkoldu — including an Aspirant — with a
personal possession and the demon’s true name.
This increases the difficulty to Nearly Impossible
(–10) vs. the target’s willpower or Spirit. After casting
this spell, regardless of success or failure, that
particular Tharkoldu cannot be summoned again
for a year and a day.
There is great risk in utilizing this spell. When
the duration ends, the Tharkoldu does not vanish,
and is likely very angry. This rare ritual enrages
technodemons. It is wise for the acolyte to be far
away before releasing the technodemon. Even then,
the Tharkoldu live a long time and are gifted with
long memories. The technodemons hold a grudge
and remember those who have made them do
such a humiliating act. Those who use this ritual
should be wary.
Should the caster or the caster’s allies KO or kill
the summoned technodemon, the caster will be
unable to cast this spell for a year and a day.
Worst of all, due to the energies involved, casting
this spell always draws technodemons as though a
Mishap occurred after a Tharkoldu Attack Cosm card
was played, even when completed successfully.
This spell can only be used in the cosm of Tharkold.
It automatically fails if used in any other cosms.
Success Levels:
• Good: The duration increases to 10 minutes.

 "Prerequisites: Beta clearance.
Nightmare Trees are a horrible device used to
infiltrate other realities by the Gaunt Man and
leech their Possibilities. Autumnal Slumber is a ritual
designed to temporarily suppress a Nightmare
Tree’s power.
To cast this ritual, the occultist must find one of
the roots stretching out from the Nightmare Tree.
Once located, the Occultist plunges her hand into
the dirt grasping the end of the root and pulling it
out of the ground like a large writhing worm. While
maintaining a firm grasp on the root with one hand
she walks counterclockwise around the tree. She
uproots more of the Nightmare Tree as she does
this and begins wrapping the root around the trunk
of the tree. As long as the Occultist holds the root of
the tree, she is protected from all attempts by the tree
to harm her. When the Occultist finishes wrapping
the trees root around it, she produces a silver nail
and a hammer, placing the end of the root against
the trunk of the tree, and then driving the nail into
the root securing it against the tree. This binds the
Nightmare tree to itself for a time.
Casting this ritual is not without risk. Maintaining
such close contact with a Nightmare Tree and having
the sap spill onto the casters flesh or clothing exposes
her to the taint of the tree. The Occultist must test
Corruption (Hard DN 14) upon completion of this
ritual. The Corruption test has no impact on the
success or failure of Autumnal Slumber.
For the duration of Autumnal Slumber, the
Nightmare Tree is placed into a slumber like state.
It cannot attack or use any of its powers. During
this time, the Nightmare Tree does not have access
to the Possibilities of the stelae network it has
infiltrated either.
If the Occultist is willing to risk testing Corruption
(Very Hard DN 16) she may drain one Possibility
from the Nightmare Tree upon completing this
ritual. This may only be done once per completion
of casting Autumnal Slumber.

 "This ritual requires some of the targets blood, hair,
skin, or similar body part. Detect Curse is a divining
ritual that can reveal the target’s true nature. The
Occultist draws a magical circle, lights incense,
and combines the target’s body part with other
components in a bowl. This concoction is consumed
by the caster at the conclusion of this rite. The
nature of the target is then revealed to the Occultist.
Though, the target is aware of the intrusion.
Upon completion of this ritual, the caster must
test Corruption (Standard DN 10). The Corruption
test has no impact on the success or failure of this
ritual. On a standard success, the Occultist knows if
the target has any Corruption Perks, and how many.
The ritual tells the Occultist with absolute certainty
if the target is a creature of supernatural evil or not.
Success Levels:
• Good: The Occultist knows if and what kind of
curse the target is affected by or what kind of
monsters the target is. Any Corruption Perks
possessed are identified by name.
• Outstanding: As Good, plus the target is
unaware of the intrusion."}

 "This gruesome ritual requires the occultist to
pluck out her eye upon completion of casting. The
ritual starts with the caster carefully preparing her
hand by cutting ancient runes into her fingertips.
Once this task is completed, she must immediately
place her bleeding fingertips into her eye socket
and pull out her own eyeball. If the runes were cut
into her flesh correctly, the eye is pulled free with
ease and, miraculously, the occultist can still see
through the eye.
At the conclusion of the ritual, the caster tests
divination. On a success the she suffers one Wound
until her eye is returned to its socket.
Once removed the eye functions as normal, though
a slight transformation takes place. The optical
nerves form into two small appendages that allow
the eye to creep along the ground at a Movement
speed of 10. The eye cannot run.
The eye is difficult to spot. Anyone looking for it
must make a Heroic (DN 18) find or Mind test to spot
it and recognize what it is.
The eye is vulnerable to attack though its size does
make it harder to hit. All attackers suffer a –6 Size
penalty and the eye’s Defenses are all 8. The eye only
has a Toughness of 2. Any Shock or Wounds dealt
to the eye immediately destroy it.
The range of Eye Scry is unlimited. If the eye can
travel that distance it can see everything within
the normal capabilities of the Occultist who cast
it. Once the duration ends, the eye immediately
becomes lifeless. If the caster retrieves the eye and it
is undamaged, she can place it back into her socket,
recovering the Wound and regaining her vision.
If the eye is destroyed while outside of the
Occultists head, even if returned to her socket, she
is now blind in that eye.
The caster may increase the movement of Eye Scry
by +4 (for a total of 14) by risking a Corruption test
(Standard DN 10). The movement of Eye Scry is
increased regardless of the results of the Corruption
test. Eye Scry can only be modified in this way once
per the casting of this ritual.
Success Levels:
• Good: The eye gains the ability to Fly at Speed
10 and can run.
• Outstanding: As Good and the duration
increases to 4 hours."}

 "Piecing together the clues from an investigation
can present quite a challenge. The clues to solve
a mystery are not always obvious or apparent.
This ritual can help the caster organize and fill
in any gaps.
To complete this ritual, the occultist needs a
bulletin board, large canvas, or a clear spot on a
wall. She then places notes , clues, pictures, and any
discovered information on the board and connects
loose pieces of twine or yarn to each. Then she
releases magical energy into the area and allows it
to guide her in her thought process.
On a Standard success, Link Chart reveals one piece
of significant information related to the mystery
the caster is trying to solve. This information is
something she did not previously know, or guidance
towards where to make a potential discovery.
If the ritual fails or there are no discoveries left
to make, or the notes and clues on the board aren’t
from a single investigation the board bursts into
flame and all the materials are destroyed.

 "This macabre ritual requires the occultist to have
the hand of a dead humanoid. The hand must still
have flesh. The ritual automatically fails if cast on
a skeletal hand. The caster soaks the disembodied
hand in foul-smelling fluids while chanting.
Upon completion of the ritual, the pinky finger
and thumb shrivel and curl up while the remaining
fingers remain straight. If the hand is kept visible on
the Occultist (typically worn as a talisman around
the neck) it grants protection against harm.
In addition to the apportation test to cast this
ritual, the Occultist must test Corruption (DN 12).
The Corruption test has no bearing on if the ritual
succeeds or fails.
On a Standard casting success the talisman allows
anyone wielding it to Soak (including Ords) damage
without spending a Possibility. Each Soak attempt
where the Monkey’s Paw is used causes one of the
straight fingers to curl up like the pinky and thumb.
Once the Monkey’s Paw has been used to make three
Soak attempts, the hand rapidly withers and turns
into dust. The Monkey’s Paw holds its power until
all three Soak attempts have been used.
Success Levels:
• Good: All Soak rolls with the paw are made
at a +2.

made at a +4."}

 "Nightmares are powerful monsters which stalk
Orrorsh. Many Storm Knights attempt to find
ways to defeat these creatures, but end up drawing
their attention before they have discovered any
vulnerability. Drawing the notice of a Nightmare
has cost the lives of many Storm Knights or the Ords
around them.
Nightmare Aegis is a ritual designed to misdirect
the sight of a Nightmare. To complete this ritual, the
occultist must posses at least one piece of information
about the specific Nightmare—specifically from one
of the five investigation categories which defines it
as described on page 73.
With this knowledge in mind, she focuses on it,
calling to the Nightmare and drawing its attention.
Once the Nightmare begins to look for her, the
Occultist forms the shield around herself and her
allies and redirects the Nightmare’s gaze elsewhere.
This leads the Nightmare on a wild goose chase and
gives her and her allies more time to act without the
gaze of the creature upon them.
On a Standard success, the occultist has fooled
the Nightmare for long enough to make it look
elsewhere for her and her companions. All attempts
by the Nightmare to locate the Storm Knight and
those she deems as her companions, fail for 24 hours.
The occultist may opt to double the duration of
Nightmare Aegis by testing Corruption (Very Hard
DN 16) and choosing a specific person to divert the
Nightmare’s attention to. It feels to the creature as
if that person is investigating them, and they act
accordingly. The duration is increased no matter the
result of the Corruption test.
Success Levels:
• Good: The duration increases to 48 hours.
• Outstanding: The duration increases to 72
hours."}

 "Pestilence is a risky ritual that can wreak great
havoc upon one’s enemies. To perform this ritual,
the Occultist must have something that belonged
to a person who died of a sickness — bandages,
clothing, a handkerchief, and similar things will
suffice. The diseased belonging is then ground up,
burned, or otherwise shaped into dust. Finally,
the occultist mixes in other components to make
a magically infected powder that she blows into
the wind. These particles seek out her targets and
infect them.
In addition to making the conjuration test to cast
this ritual, the Occultist must also test Corruption
(Challenging DN 12). The result of the Corruption
test has no impact on the success or failure
of the ritual.
Pestilence infects all targets directly downwind
within the ritual’s range. Each target is allowed a
Hard (DN 14) Strength test to fight off the disease.
Failure means that the target is infected. Any targets
who fail the test immediately suffer a –1 to all
Attributes as they become ill.
The disease that Pestilence creates has a short,
but devastating lifespan. Over the next 72 hours
each target infected must make another Hard (DN
14) Strength test at each 24-hour mark or suffer a
cumulative –1 penalty to all Attributes, up to a total
of –3 to all attributes on the third day. After the
third day, the targets begin to recover, eliminating
one point of penalty each day until they have no
penalty at all.
Additionally, any target infected by Pestilence
becomes a temporary carrier of the magical disease.
Anyone who comes into physical contact with
someone with a current penalty must test Strength
(Challenging DN 12) or become infected themselves
as above. The new target in turn becomes a carrier
who can infect others.
Any creature that has a Corruption Perk tracks
the penalty but ignores its effect on attributes. Such
creatures are technically immune, but still count
as carriers of the magical disease for as long as the
penalty would affect them.
Success Levels:
• Good: The caster is immune to the effects of
the disease she creates.
• Outstanding: As Good and the caster chooses
5 other targets that are immune."}

 "Those who have suffered the effects of Corruption
Perks have a stain on their soul. To draw that stain
out, it has to come to the surface. The temptations
incur Corruption are strong, but there are ways to
temporarily cheat Orrorsh.
While casting this ritual, the physical expression
of corruption becomes exaggerated: disfigurements
become obvious, moles look grotesque, old wounds
reappear and fester, etc. This temporary ugliness
is similar to the effects of Darkness Perks in Aysle,
and no coincidence. At the climax of the ritual,
the occultist must choose a target to inflict her
Corruption Perk upon.
Regardless of if the target is an object or a person,
the Occultist must test Corruption (Hard DN 14).
This ritual is resolved despite the outcome of the
Corruption test.
On a standard success the occultist can temporarily
gains +1 Charisma and ignores the effects of
Corruption Perks for the duration. If the target
is a alive it suffers a –1 Charisma penalty for the
duration, and temporarily inherits all the ghastly
manifestations of Corruption that manifested
during the casting. An object targeted by Transfer
Corruption becomes warped and twisted. The caster
must keep this object on her person or the duration
immediately ends.
During the ritual’s duration the caster doesn’t
register as supernatural evil or in possession
of Corruption Perks for Detect Curse and other
similar senses.
Transfer Corruption only removes the physical
aspects of Corruption from the caster. Corruption
can still be detected in the caster through magical or
other supernatural means. If the target is Defeated
or destroyed the duration ends and the caster must
test Defeat as well.
Success Levels:
• Good: The duration increases to 48 hours.
• Outstanding: As Good, plus the caster gains a
+2 bonus to Charisma and the target suffers a –2
penalty to Charisma for the duraction."}
