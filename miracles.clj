Banish
Axiom Level: 9
Skill: Faith 12
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Target’s willpower or Spirit
Range: 5-meter radius
Duration: Instant
Banish repels spirits, ghosts, or other ethereal
beings back to whatever nether realm they came
from. The invoker should not linger in such haunted
places, however, for even banished spirits can return!
Compare the invoker’s faith total to the willpower
or Spirit of every such entity within five meters
of the caster. Creatures affected fade into nothing
for 15 minutes.
Success Levels:
• Good: Affected entities are banished for one
hour.
• Outstanding: Affected entities are banished
for one day.
Bless
Axiom Level: 9
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 5-meter radius
Duration: 3 rounds
Bless surrounds and infuses the caster and his
allies with spiritual energy that boosts their physical
or mental abilities. The priest chooses any one
attribute and calls on his deity to enhance it. “May
the Lord give us the might of Daniel in the Lion’s
Den!“ increases Strength, for example. Or “May
Vishnu grant you clarity!“ might enhance Mind.
If successful, every ally in range adds +1 to that
attribute. Increasing Strength or Spirit does not
increase the derived statistics of Toughness and
Shock, however.
Success Levels:
• Good: Duration increases to 1 minute.
• Outstanding: As Good, and the attribute
increases by +2.

Bounty
Axiom Level: 10
Skill: Faith 12
Casting Time: 3 Minutes
DN: Easy (DN 8)
Range: 10 meters
Duration: Permanent
Bounty multiplies a single meal of food and water
so that more may partake. The food also becomes
more succulent and nutritious. A Standard success
doubles the available food.
Invoking the bounty requires a prayer of about
three minutes. Additional success increases the
amount of food, as shown below. Once the miracle
is invoked, the caster cannot invoke it again until
that food is consumed.
A caster with bounty virtually ensures survival
tests for food and water, but doesn’t help with
shelter if that’s a concern.
Success Levels:
• Good: ×3 the available food.
• Outstanding: ×5 the available food.
Call Animals
Axiom Level: 8
Skill: Faith 12
Casting Time: 1 minute
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 1 kilometer
Duration: 1 hour
The blessed of many religions find comfort in
nature’s beasts. This miracle draws them from the
area, if they exist there (GM’s call). Once completed
the creatures arrive on the invoker’s next turn.
Calling such creatures doesn’t mean control,
however. That must be done via commune with
animals (below). Those who want to run with the
beasts must take care that they are not eaten by them.
A Standard success summons a flock of sparrows,
a few foxes or cats, etc., or a single large creature
such as a wolf, bear, or crocodile. The miracle
worker doesn’t have to see the animals to call them.
Success Levels:
• Good: The caster can summon one bonus die
of crocodiles, wolves, lions, or similar size
creatures.
• Outstanding: The caster can summon two
bonus dice of the creatures listed under a
Good success, or a single Large or Very Large
creature such as a dragon or tyrannosaurus
rex (in the Living Land). Remember, call
animals doesn’t grant control, however!
Commune with Animals
Axiom Level: 6
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 10 meters
Duration: 5 minutes
Speaking with beasts is a rare but ancient tradition
in certain cultures. Most animals are very simpleminded and can only communicate basic ideas.
Most can only count to about three and cannot
understand human speech. They can communicate
whether people they encountered spoke happily,
calmly, angrily, etc., however.
The miracle affects all animals of the same type
in Range, all wolves, all ravens, etc. Commune with
animals doesn’t summon the beasts, however. They
must be present or attracted somehow, such as by
the call animals miracle.
Success Levels:
• Good: The animal also obeys basic commands
if instructed, as long as it doesn’t recklessly
endanger its life.
• Outstanding: The animal obeys basic
commands even if it means danger or certain
death.
Commune with Spirits
Axiom Level: 5
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 minute
DN: Challenging (DN 12)
Range: 5 meters
Duration: 5 minutes
This miracle allows the invoker to talk to whatever
spirits are appropriate to his mythos. A Christian
might speak to the restless shades while a Sioux
shaman communes with nature spirits.
Invoking the dialogue assumes the character is
in a place where the spirit should be present—a
church for saints, a stream for water spirits, a great

MIRACLES

tree for a nature spirit, etc. If not and the mythos
allows communication with the spirits outside their
usual domain, the caster suffers a −4 penalty. The
Game Master may also decide it’s just not possible
in certain situations—there are likely no earth
spirits aboard an airplane, for example.
Spirits know different things depending on
the type, and see things from their perspective.
They are not omniscient and generally only have
knowledge of subjects directly connected to their
former life for the dead or their local area for animal
spirits and the like. Unlike the speak with dead spell,
this miracle compels the spirit to tell only truth—
though it may be vague or difficult to understand
as the Game Master sees fit.
The chosen may ask a single question with a
Standard success. Once contacted, spirits are
unavailable again for a scene.
Success Levels:
• Good: Two questions.
• Outstanding: Three questions.
Cure Disease
Axiom Level: 10
Skill: Faith 14
Casting Time: 1 minute
DN: Easy (DN 8)
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Cure disease eradicates any sort of malignant
condition, infection, or malady. This doesn’t heal
the victim of any damage she’s already sustained,
it simply removes the disease or illness and stops
any future symptoms.
A character may only attempt to cure disease once
for each particular malady, per person. The same
person may attempt to cure a new disease on the
same patient, should he contract one.
A Standard success cures common ailments like
colds. Additional successes are required for more
advanced diseases.
Success Levels:
• Good: Flu, pneumonia, most infections
caused by non-supernatural creatures.
• Outstanding: AIDS, cancer, or infections
caused by supernatural creatures.
Curse
Axiom Level: 9
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Target’s faith or Spirit
Range: 25 meters
Duration: 3 rounds
Curse diminishes a foe’s luck, challenging his
faith in the very forces that drive him, whether they
be religious, personal, or otherwise.
A cursed individual suffers a −1 penalty to all
skill or attribute totals. Powerful casters can MultiTarget to affect large numbers of the faithless.
Success Levels:
• Good: −2 penalty.
• Outstanding: –3 penalty.
Healing
Axiom Level: 10
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Perhaps the most important ability a chosen one
brings to a band of Storm Knights is her ability to
heal. Whether she’s patching up her teammate’s
wounds or winning over injured villagers, healing
is a critical skill.
The invoker’s total is modified by the target’s
Wound penalties (as well as the caster’s if he
happens to be wounded). A success heals 1 Wound,
all Shock, and removes KO.
Healing may only be attempted on a single
individual once per scene—choose wisely! If Maru
is injured in a fight and healed by Father Damien,
he won’t be able to heal her again until the next
scene. He could still use first aid on her, and may
use healing on his other comrades.
Success Levels:
• Good: 2 Wounds are healed.
• Outstanding: 3 Wounds are healed.
Hellfire
Axiom Level: 16
Skill: Faith 14
Casting Time: 1 action
202
DN: Target’s dodge or Dexterity
Range: 5 meters
Duration: Instant
Hellfire projects a gout of flame from the invoker’s
outstretched palm. The flames deal 13 fire damage.
Success Levels:
• Good: Damage +1BD.
• Outstanding: Damage +2BD.
Lightning Strike
Axiom Level: 16
Skill: Faith 14
Casting Time: See below
DN: Target’s dodge or Dexterity
Range: 100 meters
Duration: Instant
Lightning strike is a rare display of divine wrath.
To invoke it, the blessed individual spends one
entire turn doing nothing but castigating a single
foe. The caller must be able to see his foe when the
miracle begins, and may only take simple actions
during this turn.
While the lightning builds, tendrils of holy
power, storm clouds, and arcs of electricity gather
around the invoker. If he is injured during this
time, he must make a willpower or Spirit test, see
Concentration, 197.
On his next turn, he may use an action to complete
the invocation and make his faith test. If successful,
the target is struck by a bolt of lightning that causes
20 damage, AP 4.
There is no penalty for range, cover, or darkness.
Perks and other spells, miracles, powers, or
supernatural abilities apply normally.
Lightning strike may only be used once per scene—
such forces do not lend their attention lightly!
Success Levels:
• Good: Damage +1BD.
• Outstanding: Damage +2BD.
Repel
Axiom Level: 10
Skill: Faith 12
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 5 meters
Duration: Instant
Sometimes a holy champion simply needs to clear
a path through his foes or humble a nonbeliever
with a visible display of otherworldly might.
Moonwalker calls upon the power of Lanala to heal an injured triceratops.
203 MIRACLES
203
Repel summons an invisible force radiating out
from the caster in a circle that pushes away all hostile
characters and creatures (allies are unaffected).
The force has Strength equal to the invoker’s
faith and affects those enemies of equal or lesser
Strength. Those affected are pushed back five
meters and Stymied.
Success Levels:
• Good: The effective Strength is equal to faith +2.
• Outstanding: As a Good result, and the foes
are Very Stymied.
Soothe
Axiom Level: 7
Skill: Faith 10
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 5 meters
Duration: Instant
Soothe sends out a refreshing wave of energy
to the invoker and allies in range. Those affected
instantly recover 2 Shock.
Success Levels:
• Good: The affected recover 3 Shock.
• Outstanding: The affected recover 4 Shock.
Strike
Axiom Level: 12
Skill: Faith 12
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Sometimes even the most peaceful of the chosen
must pick up the staff. This powerful miracle makes
sure that staff packs a punch. Strike affects a single
weapon, no Multi-Targeting is allowed.
Strike increases the damage value of a weapon
by +1. It doesn’t matter if the weapon is ranged
or designed for melee — its base damage is
still increased. Strike must be cast on a weapon,
not ammunition.
A weapon blessed with strike counts as
magical for purposes of affecting foes with the
Ethereal or similar abilities that generally ignore
normal weapons.
Success Levels:
• Good: Damage +2.
• Outstanding: Damage +3.
Ward Enemy
Axiom Level: 8
Skill: Faith 8
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Standard (DN 10)
Range: 5 meter radius
Duration: Concentration
Ward enemy protects the faithful from supernatural
beings that prey on or seek to harm humanity.
To cast, the invoker must brandish a holy symbol,
recite prayers, or otherwise clearly call on the source
of his power, making him an obvious target for the
taunts of spirits, demons, or other antagonists likely
to be affected.
While the ward is active, all allies within five meters
add +1 to their defenses versus supernaturally
evil creatures and their attacks. The bonus counts
toward both physical and interaction defenses.
Special: This miracle may be attempted without
the Miracles Perk if the faith prerequisite is met.
Success Levels:
• Good: Those protected add +2 to all defenses.
• Outstanding: As the Good result, and
supernaturally evil creatures who fail an
attack against any of the protected individuals
are Stymied.
Wither
Axiom Level: 16
Skill: Faith 14
Casting Time: 1 action
DN: Target’s faith or Spirit
Range: 5 meters
Duration: Instant
This dark miracle drains the life force of any
living thing it touches.
With a successful faith roll, the invocation causes
12 damage that ignores all physical armor. Wither
works only on living things—it has no effect on
objects, constructs, undead, etc.
Success Levels:
• Good: Damage +1BD.
• Outstanding: Damage +2BD.
