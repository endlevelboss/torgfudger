may be created between scenes, or during downtime if the Game Master feels it’s appropriate.
Slayer’s guns are designed to rotate quickly and

the world. The Delphi Council understands the
mystical nature of these awards, however, and

possible. Work with the Game Master to figure
out the timing of the medal itself, but it should
generally occur no later than the act after it was
earned. The Perk may be purchased once the medal

Spirit if Shock is restored.
A Berserker is dangerous to her own, however. If
she rolls a Mishap on a melee weapons or unarmed

Telling the tale requires an audience, a

zone modifiers (−4 in a Dominant Zone and –8 in
a Pure Zone).
Tales may be told once per act, and only in a zone
where the Storyteller took part in playing a Glory
card within the last month. The performer doesn’t
have to have played the card himself, he just has
to have been present at the event.
The Storyteller gains a separate pool of Possibilities,
one on a standard success, two on a Good, and
three on an Outstanding. For the rest of the act,
the Storm Knight can spend these Possibilities for
himself or for anyone who heard the tale (GM’s

many of whom fought for the United States in
Terra’s Great War. They were chosen for their
leadership as opposed to their physical prowess,
and proved to be a critical weapon against the forces
of Germany and her allies, including Mexico. After
the war the Rocket Rangers continued to operate
under the control of the American government, but
some Rangers realized the threat Doctor Mobius
presented and joined the Mystery Men on their
way to Earth.
Members of the Rocket Rangers utilize rocket
propelled suits, powered with an ingot of eternium.
Once fully upgraded a ranger can fly faster than
prop-driven fighters, smash through airplanes, and
even crash into the ground without major damage.
The base model Mk 1 Rocket Ranger battlesuit
is piloted with the air vehicles skill and has the
following properties:
• The Flight pulp power, however the ranger
can fly at 20 meters per round or 160 meters
per round (Value 11) if “rushing.”.
• Armor +4: Reduces Collision damage by -4.
Max Dex 8, Fatigue +2, Weakness to Cold (see
page 21).
• Since the battlesuit is powered by eternium,
it does not have a Tech Axiom, but is a
contradiction anywhere pulp powers would
be.
Unfortunately, despite the tendency of the
battlesuit to overheat, it is still susceptible to seizing
up when exposed to extreme cold.

to narratively come up with unique and interesting
ways to solve problems.
Weird scientists often have a compulsion to create
new inventions, which may or may not work, and
then abandon them to create something new.
Once per scene, the hero can use locally available
parts and tools (GM’s call) to create a device to aid
in overcoming a particular obstacle (e.g. picking
an unpickable lock, hang gliding off a cliff, or
making an improvised weapon). These devices
really shouldn’t function with the materials and
tools available, but they really do work. Most of the
time. Briefly. Once.
The nature of the device doesn't need to make
pure scientific sense, but should be different than
recent uses of this Perk. No spamming!
The time it takes to construct the device is up to
the GM, but usually takes at least 10 minutes to
several hours. The player must come up with an
interesting description of the device.
When it comes time to use the device, the Storm
Knight rolls a science test. The test is only rolled
when it is dramatically appropriate, any roll prior
to when the device is really needed doesn’t apply.
If the weird scientist doesn't have a gizmo kit, the
test is Hard (DN 14). The test is related to this pulp
power, and so it does create a contradiction.
On a success the device functions and can be used
to overcome the hero’s problem, though this may
require additional skill tests (e.g. lockpicking or air
vehicles). On a Good Success the hero grants a +2
bonus to a single skill or attribute test involving the
problem. On an Outstanding Success that bonus is
+4 instead.
On a Mishap something particularly dramatic or
amusing occurs.
Enhancements:
• Favored: The hero’s science tests to create a
device are Favored.
• Quick: If the device's construction is relatively
simple (GM's call) such as tin foil, chewing
gum, and a paperclip, the hero can sacrifice his
action to construct the device in a single round.
He can still move as normal to assemble the
device. The device is completed at the end of
the hero's turn."}

 "Some dwarves know a secret, ancient language of
symbolic runes imbued with arcane power. There
is no spoken equivalent, but those who learn runes
may carve them into stones or metal to bring out
their properties.
Most runes are usually cast on small, flat stones
and broken to release their power. It takes one
action to carve a rune on a stone. This is a casting
action, and uses the language: dwarven runes skill for
the test. Carving may be done outside of combat,
presetting the available runes.
Another action is used to throw or break the stone
and unleash its magic. This action uses the missile
weapons skill, and has a Range of 5/10/15. The stone
detonates on impact as long as it hits some sort of
solid surface. A runemaker carries one blank stone
for each rune he knows (see below) and can make
new stones with an hour of time and access to tools
and rock.
   A permanent rune may be carved into any item
made of stone, metal, or bone. The process takes an
hour, and once finished it remains until the item is
destroyed. A runed item has the power described,
and the power may be activated or deactivated as
a free action without any kind of test. Runemakers
may use the item or give it to an ally. A runed item
has a Magic Axiom of 14.
Choose any three of the runes below. Runes
channel the dwarf’s own magical energy, so they
may have no more than three runes in existence at
any one time—including permanent runes. If more
are carved, the additional stones have no magical
“spark“ and simply fail to work.
Extra Runes: This Perk may be taken more than
once. Each time after the first, the dwarf learns
a new rune but is still limited to only three in
existence at once.

Young drakes have wings and a limited ability to

 "The mage has learned enough to create a new spell
from experimentation. When this Perk is taken the
character gains a slot for a new spell, to be filled
once the experiment is complete. This Perk may be
taken multiple times, and each time a new slot for
an invented spell is added.
To create a spell the caster first dedicates time
and resources to the process. This requires five
days and consumes Value Level 15 worth of magic
items. Each +1 Value beyond 15 grants a +1 bonus
to the test at the end of the process.
With the resources committed, the mage gives the
spell a unique name, sets the appropriate magical
skill, the minimum skill needed to cast the new
spell, and the DN. The higher the DN and minimum
skill, the more powerful the end result may be.
The caster designates the Magic Axiom for the
spell, referencing the guidelines in Torg Eternity. A
spell that does a little more than an axiom normally
allows might be possible, but counts as more
powerful overall.
Set the Casting Time (1 Hour, 1 Minute, 1 Action,
Simple), the Range (Self, Touch, 10 meters, 25
meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, 1 kilometer), and
the Duration (Permanent, 1 Hour, Concentration,
3 Rounds, Instant). The more powerful options
for each category are the latter ones listed. A spell
doesn’t need to use exactly the options listed above,
but unique entries are generally considered more
potent for the end spell.
Finally, the caster must assign the effect desired
for a standard success casting, a Good success, an
Outstanding success, and if there’s any additional
unfortunate effect if Backlash occurs.
Once all the properties are set the player submits
the spell to the GM and begins research. The GM
sets a secret (not transparent as usual) research
DN, starting at a base of 20 and applying difficulty
modifiers based on how powerful the finished spell
would be and how much impact it would have on
the game. A relatively small and simple spell might
be Very Easy (+4, so only DN 16 to research), while
a very potent and dangerous spell could be Nearly
Impossible (–10, so DN 30) to research!
A spell that’s unacceptable to the GM for any
reason is impossible regardless of the test result, but
that’s secret until a test rolls so high it’s obviously
impossible.
At the beginning of a game session the mage
rolls a test against the secret DN using scholar or
the appropriate magic skill, whichever is lower.
Possibilities and Destiny Cards may be spent on
this test. If the test fails the GM simply says the
spell isn’t working, and the research may continue
paying the same costs as before. If the test succeeds
it produces a working “unstable” version of the
spell, and the DN is revealed.
Researchers may use unstable spells in play, but
Backlash is doubled. Gaining an Outstanding result
on the spell in a Dramatic Scene or succeeding at
the research process a second time stabilizes the
spell. It’s added to the spell list appropriate to the
caster and other mages may learn it normally.
An unstable spell may be abandoned and a new
spell research cycle started, or refined. The caster
changes one property of the spell, the GM assigns
a new DN, and the research cycle repeats as above.
Its possible to learn an unstable version of a known
spell, then refine it to improve it!"}

 "Although perceived as pets by non-witches,
familiars are in fact spirits that assist witches in
the casting of spells and other witch abilities. The
exact form of these spirits can vary significantly.
White witches generally befriend animal
spirits, though more esoteric nature spirits are
common too. Cyberwitches are more likely to
befriend technological spirits which can manifest
holographically. A common tech spirit is a
bit, which can only speak yes or no, while
temporarily transforming its form between three
geometric states (one for each response, and a
resting state).
Familiars remain in close proximity to their
witch, but they instinctively avoid detection when
threatened and cannot be directly targeted. Although
they are magical beings, familiars bond so fully with
their witch, they are essentially treated as part of the
witch themselves, and contradictions are only based
on the witch herself. Wherever the witch is, the
familiar follows, whether the witch is individually
teleported or even logs into the GodNet.
No matter the form, these spirits are manifestations
of the eight Pagan virtues. The witch selects one
virtue from the list below and gains the associated
ability. They also learn two spells.
Witches who align with familiars are often referred
to according to their spirit (i.e. a Compassionate
witch, or a Strong witch)."}

Some abominations have had their DNA
recombined with that of a bear, cat, dog, or something
far worse. Others have had their entire biological
structure changed to where they resemble something
barely humanoid. Over time, and with additional
exposure to the hot spots in the Blasted Land, more
mutations become apparent—both enhancing and
debilitating. No two mutants are the same.
The character is immune to environmental
radiation (see Environmental Hazards in Torg

Cosm Card is played. An attack based on hard
radiation still does normal damage.
The effects of the mutation cause some form of
disfigurement: fur, scales, scars, etc. The character
is considered an Outsider and suffers a –4 penalty
to persuasion tests unless the disfigurement is
concealed with heavy clothing or some other means.
Additionally, the character must make a roll on the

Additionally, the abomination selects one of the
following mutations.

 :description
 "When some beings die in an especially
tragic or emotional way, their spirits linger
and haunt the living. Most ghosts are
bound to a location—often the place they
died — but some elect to follow specific
people, and reality-rated spirits can range
anywhere they choose. Ghosts have powerful traits
that are treated like racial abilities:
Ethereal: Ghosts are spirits rather than flesh, and
have a hard time interacting with the physical
world. They ignore physical attacks and damage,
but can’t use equipment at all. Powers, or items
affected by powers and their equivalents (such as
magical weapons) may affect a ghost normally.
Ghosts may use Interaction Attacks, but must
spend 2 Shock to make a regular attack (including
using powers such as Spells, Miracles, or Psionics).
Float: Ghosts don’t walk, they float several inches
off the ground. Many pretend to walk. Ghosts
ignore penalties for terrain, but they cannot run.
They must have some kind of ground or surface
to float atop—although falling does no damage
to a ghost.
Uncanny: There’s something off-putting
about a ghost’s appearance. It could be
subtle things like not breathing or
blinking, or more overt like a twisted
neck or feet. Whatever the cause,
living creatures (especially animals)
instinctively abhor a ghost. Ghosts
suffer a –4 on all persuasion and
streetwise tests.
Undead: The ghost does not
breathe air, need to eat or drink,
and is unaffected by poisons
or effects that require living
processes.
The largest threat to a ghost‘s
humanity is madness. Spirits
are beings composed entirely
of memories and emotions.
When memories become
muddled — or emotions
too strong — ghosts risk
losing themselves to rage or fear or
revenge. Such lost souls exist only to
terrify the living and push them towards
their own deaths."}

 :Prereq "Dexterity 8+."
 :description
 "No one knows the true source of this curse, but
it’s transmitted through the blood and spread
through much of Gaea before coming to Earth
with the Victorians. Those afflicted thirst for blood.
Any blood will do for sustenance, but the blood of
sapient species has a special draw.
Allergies: Direct sunlight causes 10+1BD damage
each Round a vampire is exposed to it. Clothing
that offers Full Coverage counts as +5 Armor
against this damage only. Any other kind of armor
or clothing offers +2 Armor protection and nothing
more.
Blood Drain: Vampires have fangs that deal
Strength +2 damage. They may only attack a
Grappled opponent, but they automatically strike
the target’s lowest Armor value. If the target is the
same race then any Shock and Wounds dealt by the
bite are simultaneously recovered by the vampire.
The bite deals normal damage to other races, but
has no restorative properties. Blood drain deals
only Strength damage to a target with no blood or
living processes.
Mentalist: Vampires may take the Psionic Perk
and any of the following powers: alter memory,
clairvoyance, cloud mind, confusion, mind control,
and psychic shield. An Orrorsh vampire may take
powers that exceed his Social Axiom, but using
such abilities risks Disconnection normally. The
strange nature of these powers suggests that the
vampire curse didn’t originate in Gaea.
Undead: Vampires do not breathe air, do not need
to eat or drink, and are not affected by poisons or
effects that require living processes.
The main threat to a vampire’s humanity is the
same hunger that drives them. The temptation to
feed upon the living, especially when injured, can
be overwhelming. When a vampire loses himself he
becomes a pure predator, thinking of all the living
as nothing more than cattle ready for slaughter."}
{:name "Werewolf"

 :Prereq "Strength 8+"
 :description
 "Werewolves transform into beasts. The
transformation can be triggered on purpose (taking
a full turn), as a free reaction to suffering a Wound,
or automatically during a full moon. The trick is
returning to normal requires the beast to kill —
which may mean a Corruption test. The victim
killed may be an animal or an opponent, the curse
isn’t particular. Reverting back to normal isn’t
immediate; the werewolf chooses when to change,
which also triggers the Corruption test.
The curse is transmitted by attacks. Lore proposes
that anyone severely injured by a werewolf who
survives might become cursed, but in actuality it’s
only those special cases who are slain but rise again
under the power of the curse — appearing to have
survived the attack when really they did not.
Allergies: Silver weapons and bullets deal +4
damage to lycanthropes. In addition, Wounds
caused by silver don’t heal from the Regeneration
ability below. Allergies apply whether the werewolf
is in normal or beast form.
Bite/Claws: In beast form only, the werewolf gains
a Bite/Claws attack that deals Strength+2 damage.
Regeneration: All Wounds and injuries
automatically heal at the end of each scene—even
death! Wounds caused by silver weapons only
heal at the normal rate. Death caused by a silver
weapon is permanent, and is death if such an
attack is delivered after the werewolf is Defeated
as a Coup de Gras. Regeneration applies to both
the lycanthrope’s forms.
Savagery: While in beast form only, the werewolf
gains a +2 bonus to Strength. If a target, friend or
foe, is within reach after movement the werewolf
must All-Out Attack, and the Friendly Fire rules
apply to melee attacks if multiple targets are within
reach. If any target is within the werewolf’s Move
he must end next to a target, but within those
constraints he can move however he desires.
If a failed Corruption test would eliminate the
character, he transforms completely into a beast
and never changes back. The beast may still
transmit the curse!
Werewolves are merely one strain of the curse.
Bats, tigers, and other creatures are possible."}

 "Most Orrorshan sorcerers skirt the edges of the
Abyss when they learn the arcane arts. Diabolists
jump right into the inferno, entreating with demons,
devils, and all manner of foul beings for additional
power. The representative for these powers is the
Diabolist’s imp.
Imps may be various beasts: cats, dogs, even
snakes! They are never bird or creatures of the air—
the dark powers of Orrorsh dwell below, not above.
Whatever the base creature is, it’s about half the size
of a human and always jet black. Imps are strong for
their size, but their most important characteristic is
they can speak — although most prefer not to draw
attention to themselves by doing so.
In game terms, the player should control the
imp most of the time, choosing its targets, rolling
its attacks, and speaking for it. Imps don’t have
knowledge beyond the sorcerer they are attached
to. They represent the dark powers, but don’t have
magic or powers of their own.
Imps do not have Possibilities, but the sorcerer
can spend his Possibilities (and Destiny cards) for
the creature — even if they are separated. If slain
the dark powers form a new beast to act as the
Diabolist’s imp. They aren’t pleased at having to
do so, and both they and the creature may find ways
to express this displeasure and spur the sorcerer to
employ more caution in the future.

insight, allowing the modification of existing
GeneMods so they remain stable within reality-rated
individuals, regardless of their home cosm. However
the technique is imperfect, and the results only
partially stable. Even subjects from Pan-Pacifica’s
reality suffer the cataclysmic cell degradation if too
much Third Generation GeneMod tissue is installed.
These flaws, along with the cost, mean Kanawa only
uses this technology where there’s a clear business
need. However, some underground biotech labs

research to replicate the processes involved.

unarmed combat or melee weapons as its Path skill.
This is the hero’s Minor Path. Choose one Technique
from that Path with rank 3 or lower.
5. Street Learning: Choose one Technique from
the hero’s Minor Path of rank 4 or lower.
6. The Unchosen One: Despite his heroism, the

may use persuasion instead of trick as an interaction
  attack. On a successful test, spend 1 Shock to draw
a card. This does not count as an Approved Action.
4. Step of Mercy: Spend 4 Shock to roll another

has meditation, she may spend 2 Shock to increase
the range to 5 meters and target up to six allies
without taking Multi-Targeting penalties.
8. Step of Connection: The most powerful force
in the cosmverse is the link between conscious

7. No-Mind: The hero has so attuned herself to her
art that she may use her weapon to defend against
attacks from missile weapons, firearms, and energy
weapons. When attacked, after the action total is
made, the hero may spend 1 Shock to use her melee
defense instead of dodge.
8. Perfect Timing: Spend 1 Shock to interrupt and
make a single melee combat attack as a free action

 "Wizards and magicians of all sorts frequently
use implements such as wands or to enhance
their spellcasting (see Aysle Sourcebook). Selecting
this Perk grants the wizard one of the appropriate
implements as shown below.
No matter the implement, the magician chooses
one of the magic skills, and tests using that skill are
Favored. This skill cannot be changed.
These implements have the same power as Arcane
items, but since those require a significantly higher
Magic Axiom than Core Earth has ever had, soul
implements utilize the Law of Aegis to function by
putting a piece of the user’s soul into it. Thus the
use of soul implements is contradictory outside of
Core Earth.
Should the item be destroyed or permanently lost,
the wizard suffers a temporary Injury (see Defeat in
Torg Eternity). The wizard gains a new implement
after one full act passes, which heals the Injury.
Alternatively, if the wizard has selected one of the
following Perks, they can instead gain the listed
implement:
• Spellcaster: These wands are made by the
magician, whittling branches from particular
hardwood trees such as oak, maple, or poplar
trees.
• Geomancer (Selenite Crystal): These crystals

pilgrimage to the Cave of Crystals (see page 22).
• Mythomancer: Mythomancers use a variety
of instruments (literally in the case of those
who base their spellcasting on song) to enhance
their spells. The physical form that this takes
is not important, whether it be analog or
digital, paper or silicon. What is important is
that the spellcaster compiles the stories, songs,
poems, plays, or movies themselves. The
repertoire says something profound about the
mythomancer’s soul, and whether the media
is stored on a paper page, on a DVD, or MP3
player, the device functions through the Law
of Aegis."}

 "This ability allows the geomancer and up to 8

another. The departure node can be any of the ones
on Core Earth, but the arrival node must be one
that is Magic 15 or higher. The nodes much be in a
Core Earth Dominant or Pure Zone, but can include
hardpoints (by traveling through the interior of
the Earth). Even if a reality such as Aysle has a
Magic Axiom higher than 15, it does not properly
maintain the ley line structure needed for this spell
to work.
To activate the ley node, the mage creates a circle
with chalk, sand, or other materials, around the
people who will be traveling the ley lines. As long
as the circle isn’t broken when the casting time is
complete, the travelers instantly teleport to the
desired ley node.
Under most circumstances, this casting can be done
without effort, and no test is necessary. However,
if the geomancer is activating the node under time
pressure (such as during combat), this ability is
activated through a Dramatic Skill Resolution, with

a map and two “readings” at least one kilometer
apart by making a Very Hard (DN 16) science

 :description
 "The reality-rated character may imbue one small
object with a connection to her own Cosm. The
object should have some significance within the
cosm it reflects. A baseball card might work for Core
Earth, while a tooth or claw may be appropriate for
the Living Land, an amulet for Aysle, and so on.
The Focus takes half a day and one Possibility
to create. It must be created in a space where the
character’s reality is Dominant or Pure. When the
Focus is created the character may spend up to
three Possibilities to “charge” it, and it works one
day for each Possibility spent. The item may also
charge on its own over time, one day for every day
of charge.
Possession of a Focus grants a +4 bonus on an
attempt to Reconnect. An Ord with a Focus may
operate normally in an enemy Dominant or Pure
Zone, similar to being under the effect of a Talisman
(see Torg Eternity), but a Focus only affects the
individual carrying it.
Special: This Perk is available to any reality-rated
character, including those from outside of Core
Earth. The character may only create a Focus for
his own reality."}
