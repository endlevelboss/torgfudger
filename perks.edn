potions are currently prepared and mark them off
as they are used.
Creating new potions requires 30 minutes plus
10 minutes per concoction, and a small portable
kit of assorted chemicals, reagents, and equipment.
Using Potions: Drinking a potion, elixir, or
similar concoction is a simple action. Drinking up
to three potions is a standard action.
Some potions are used in glass grenades. These
use the missile weapons skill and have a Range of
5/10/15, and detonate on impact as long as they hit
some sort of solid surface.
Extra Potions: This Perk may be taken more than
once. Each time after the first the Alchemist learns
a new potion and may have one more potion in
existence at once."}

bullets and steel blades were no match for the
horrors of their realm. Alchemy proved a great help
to their cause, and some intrepid souls eventually
combined that arcane craft with the more practical
skill of marksmanship.
When this Perk is taken, the user has a “slayer’s
gun“ and knows how to create various rounds
for it. He receives his weapon and the knowledge
to make basic metal slugs (damage 14) and any
three of the specialized rounds below. Crafted for
close encounters, the short-barrel carbine design
of the slayer’s gun allows it to be used in melee
like a pistol.
Because the bullets are necessarily large and
require exacting specifications, monster hunters
who make use of them have standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them—the
rounds don’t work in any other kind of weapon.
• Slayer’s Gun: Range 50/100/200, damage 14,
Shots 6.
Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six
special bullets as long as they have access to their
gear (which always contains a small bullet-making
kit). If more rounds are created, they lose the magical
essence the Bulletsmith inherently provides and act
as regular slugs (damage 14). Replacement rounds
may be created between scenes, or during downtime if the Game Master feels it’s appropriate.
Slayer’s guns are designed to rotate quickly and
so can fire any one of their preloaded six chambers
(specified before use). Swapping or reloading up
to three rounds is an action.
Slayer’s Bandoleer: Monster hunters wear a
specialized bandoleer designed to hold 18 shells
total (12 regular shells and their six special rounds).
Extra Shells: This Perk may be taken more than
once. Each time after the first the Bulletsmith learns
to make a new type of shell and may maintain two
more special rounds at a time.

  :description "This invasive power allows a crimefighter to
control his foes, turning them into puppets who
dance on the ends of his mental strings.
Mind Control allows a pulp hero to control a
single foe. This is a contest of willpower or Mind.
Apply a −4 penalty if the target is in a hostile state
(such as in combat). If the Mind Controller loses the
contest, the target’s mind is off-limits the remainder
of the scene.
If a target is tasked with something drastically
against his nature, such as harming an ally or
himself, he gets an immediate Mind or willpower
test to resist. The GM should modify this as she sees
fit—+4 to resist harming a loved one or
oneself, +2 to resist harming his allies.
If a subject breaks free due to such a
test, he cannot be controlled again
during that scene.
How long Mind Control lasts
depends on the success level:
• Standard: Until the end of the
target’s next turn, or about 10
seconds out of combat.
• Good: One minute.
• Outstanding: Until the
end of the current scene.
Enhancements:
• Charisma: The hero
may use persuasion
or Charisma instead
of willpower or Mind.
(The target resists
normally.)
• Control: Negate the

to narratively come up with unique and interesting
ways to solve problems.
Weird scientists often have a compulsion to create
new inventions, which may or may not work, and
then abandon them to create something new.
Once per scene, the hero can use locally available
parts and tools (GM’s call) to create a device to aid
in overcoming a particular obstacle (e.g. picking
an unpickable lock, hang gliding off a cliff, or
making an improvised weapon). These devices
really shouldn’t function with the materials and
tools available, but they really do work. Most of the
time. Briefly. Once.
The nature of the device doesn't need to make
pure scientific sense, but should be different than
recent uses of this Perk. No spamming!
The time it takes to construct the device is up to
the GM, but usually takes at least 10 minutes to
several hours. The player must come up with an
interesting description of the device.
When it comes time to use the device, the Storm
Knight rolls a science test. The test is only rolled
when it is dramatically appropriate, any roll prior
to when the device is really needed doesn’t apply.
If the weird scientist doesn't have a gizmo kit, the
test is Hard (DN 14). The test is related to this pulp
power, and so it does create a contradiction.
On a success the device functions and can be used
to overcome the hero’s problem, though this may
require additional skill tests (e.g. lockpicking or air
vehicles). On a Good Success the hero grants a +2
bonus to a single skill or attribute test involving the
problem. On an Outstanding Success that bonus is
+4 instead.
On a Mishap something particularly dramatic or
amusing occurs.
Enhancements:
• Favored: The hero’s science tests to create a
device are Favored.
• Quick: If the device's construction is relatively
simple (GM's call) such as tin foil, chewing
gum, and a paperclip, the hero can sacrifice his
action to construct the device in a single round.
He can still move as normal to assemble the
device. The device is completed at the end of
the hero's turn."}

 "Some dwarves know a secret, ancient language of
symbolic runes imbued with arcane power. There
is no spoken equivalent, but those who learn runes
may carve them into stones or metal to bring out
their properties.
Most runes are usually cast on small, flat stones
and broken to release their power. It takes one
action to carve a rune on a stone. This is a casting
action, and uses the language: dwarven runes skill for
the test. Carving may be done outside of combat,
presetting the available runes.
Another action is used to throw or break the stone
and unleash its magic. This action uses the missile
weapons skill, and has a Range of 5/10/15. The stone
detonates on impact as long as it hits some sort of
solid surface. A runemaker carries one blank stone
for each rune he knows (see below) and can make
new stones with an hour of time and access to tools
and rock.
   A permanent rune may be carved into any item
made of stone, metal, or bone. The process takes an
hour, and once finished it remains until the item is
destroyed. A runed item has the power described,
and the power may be activated or deactivated as
a free action without any kind of test. Runemakers
may use the item or give it to an ally. A runed item
has a Magic Axiom of 14.
Choose any three of the runes below. Runes
channel the dwarf’s own magical energy, so they
may have no more than three runes in existence at
any one time—including permanent runes. If more
are carved, the additional stones have no magical
“spark“ and simply fail to work.
Extra Runes: This Perk may be taken more than
once. Each time after the first, the dwarf learns
a new rune but is still limited to only three in
existence at once.

 "Dragons and their kin, regardless of size, are not
the friendliest of creatures, but the elf has managed
to bond with such a creature while it is still small.
The player controls the young drake in the same
manner as other animal companions (see Torg
Eternity). Possibilities and Destiny cards may
be spent on behalf of the drake, even when the
character isn’t physically present. Bonding grants
the character a special “way” with drakes, and if
the creature perishes, a new companion seeks the
character out within a week inside Aysle. Drakes
are notoriously jealous, so only one bond is possible
at a time.
Young drakes have wings and a limited ability to
breath fire. They can’t speak, but they are clever
animals and seem to understand most speech
directed at them. Their small size makes them
fragile, so while they are useful combatants and
distractions, a wise drake friend prioritizes the
creature’s safety above all. Drakes don’t have
hands, but can carry small objects with their rear
claws. It takes one to two years for a young drake
to mature into a beast large enough to ride.

 "The mage has learned enough to create a new spell
from experimentation. When this Perk is taken the
character gains a slot for a new spell, to be filled
once the experiment is complete. This Perk may be
taken multiple times, and each time a new slot for
an invented spell is added.
To create a spell the caster first dedicates time
and resources to the process. This requires five
days and consumes Value Level 15 worth of magic
items. Each +1 Value beyond 15 grants a +1 bonus
to the test at the end of the process.
With the resources committed, the mage gives the
spell a unique name, sets the appropriate magical
skill, the minimum skill needed to cast the new
spell, and the DN. The higher the DN and minimum
skill, the more powerful the end result may be.
The caster designates the Magic Axiom for the
spell, referencing the guidelines in Torg Eternity. A
spell that does a little more than an axiom normally
allows might be possible, but counts as more
powerful overall.
Set the Casting Time (1 Hour, 1 Minute, 1 Action,
Simple), the Range (Self, Touch, 10 meters, 25
meters, 50 meters, 100 meters, 1 kilometer), and
the Duration (Permanent, 1 Hour, Concentration,
3 Rounds, Instant). The more powerful options
for each category are the latter ones listed. A spell
doesn’t need to use exactly the options listed above,
but unique entries are generally considered more
potent for the end spell.
Finally, the caster must assign the effect desired
for a standard success casting, a Good success, an
Outstanding success, and if there’s any additional
unfortunate effect if Backlash occurs.
Once all the properties are set the player submits
the spell to the GM and begins research. The GM
sets a secret (not transparent as usual) research
DN, starting at a base of 20 and applying difficulty
modifiers based on how powerful the finished spell
would be and how much impact it would have on
the game. A relatively small and simple spell might
be Very Easy (+4, so only DN 16 to research), while
a very potent and dangerous spell could be Nearly
Impossible (–10, so DN 30) to research!
A spell that’s unacceptable to the GM for any
reason is impossible regardless of the test result, but
that’s secret until a test rolls so high it’s obviously
impossible.
At the beginning of a game session the mage
rolls a test against the secret DN using scholar or
the appropriate magic skill, whichever is lower.
Possibilities and Destiny Cards may be spent on
this test. If the test fails the GM simply says the
spell isn’t working, and the research may continue
paying the same costs as before. If the test succeeds
it produces a working “unstable” version of the
spell, and the DN is revealed.
Researchers may use unstable spells in play, but
Backlash is doubled. Gaining an Outstanding result
on the spell in a Dramatic Scene or succeeding at
the research process a second time stabilizes the
spell. It’s added to the spell list appropriate to the
caster and other mages may learn it normally.
An unstable spell may be abandoned and a new
spell research cycle started, or refined. The caster
changes one property of the spell, the GM assigns
a new DN, and the research cycle repeats as above.
Its possible to learn an unstable version of a known
spell, then refine it to improve it!"}

 "Although perceived as pets by non-witches,
familiars are in fact spirits that assist witches in
the casting of spells and other witch abilities. The
exact form of these spirits can vary significantly.
White witches generally befriend animal
spirits, though more esoteric nature spirits are
common too. Cyberwitches are more likely to
befriend technological spirits which can manifest
holographically. A common tech spirit is a
bit, which can only speak yes or no, while
temporarily transforming its form between three
geometric states (one for each response, and a
resting state).
Familiars remain in close proximity to their
witch, but they instinctively avoid detection when
threatened and cannot be directly targeted. Although
they are magical beings, familiars bond so fully with
their witch, they are essentially treated as part of the
witch themselves, and contradictions are only based
on the witch herself. Wherever the witch is, the
familiar follows, whether the witch is individually
teleported or even logs into the GodNet.
No matter the form, these spirits are manifestations
of the eight Pagan virtues. The witch selects one
virtue from the list below and gains the associated
ability. They also learn two spells.
Witches who align with familiars are often referred
to according to their spirit (i.e. a Compassionate
witch, or a Strong witch)."}

 "When some beings die in an especially
tragic or emotional way, their spirits linger
and haunt the living. Most ghosts are
bound to a location—often the place they
died — but some elect to follow specific
people, and reality-rated spirits can range
anywhere they choose. Ghosts have powerful traits
that are treated like racial abilities:
Ethereal: Ghosts are spirits rather than flesh, and
have a hard time interacting with the physical
world. They ignore physical attacks and damage,
but can’t use equipment at all. Powers, or items
affected by powers and their equivalents (such as
magical weapons) may affect a ghost normally.
Ghosts may use Interaction Attacks, but must
spend 2 Shock to make a regular attack (including
using powers such as Spells, Miracles, or Psionics).
Float: Ghosts don’t walk, they float several inches
off the ground. Many pretend to walk. Ghosts
ignore penalties for terrain, but they cannot run.
They must have some kind of ground or surface
to float atop—although falling does no damage
to a ghost.
Uncanny: There’s something off-putting
about a ghost’s appearance. It could be
subtle things like not breathing or
blinking, or more overt like a twisted
neck or feet. Whatever the cause,
living creatures (especially animals)
instinctively abhor a ghost. Ghosts
suffer a –4 on all persuasion and
streetwise tests.
Undead: The ghost does not
breathe air, need to eat or drink,
and is unaffected by poisons
or effects that require living
processes.
The largest threat to a ghost‘s
humanity is madness. Spirits
are beings composed entirely
of memories and emotions.
When memories become
muddled — or emotions
too strong — ghosts risk
losing themselves to rage or fear or
revenge. Such lost souls exist only to
terrify the living and push them towards
their own deaths."}

 :description
 "No one knows the true source of this curse, but
it’s transmitted through the blood and spread
through much of Gaea before coming to Earth
with the Victorians. Those afflicted thirst for blood.
Any blood will do for sustenance, but the blood of
sapient species has a special draw.
Allergies: Direct sunlight causes 10+1BD damage
each Round a vampire is exposed to it. Clothing
that offers Full Coverage counts as +5 Armor
against this damage only. Any other kind of armor
or clothing offers +2 Armor protection and nothing
more.
Blood Drain: Vampires have fangs that deal
Strength +2 damage. They may only attack a
Grappled opponent, but they automatically strike
the target’s lowest Armor value. If the target is the
same race then any Shock and Wounds dealt by the
bite are simultaneously recovered by the vampire.
The bite deals normal damage to other races, but
has no restorative properties. Blood drain deals
only Strength damage to a target with no blood or
living processes.
Mentalist: Vampires may take the Psionic Perk
and any of the following powers: alter memory,
clairvoyance, cloud mind, confusion, mind control,
and psychic shield. An Orrorsh vampire may take
powers that exceed his Social Axiom, but using
such abilities risks Disconnection normally. The
strange nature of these powers suggests that the
vampire curse didn’t originate in Gaea.
Undead: Vampires do not breathe air, do not need
to eat or drink, and are not affected by poisons or
effects that require living processes.
The main threat to a vampire’s humanity is the
same hunger that drives them. The temptation to
feed upon the living, especially when injured, can
be overwhelming. When a vampire loses himself he
becomes a pure predator, thinking of all the living
as nothing more than cattle ready for slaughter."}

 :description
 "Werewolves transform into beasts. The
transformation can be triggered on purpose (taking
a full turn), as a free reaction to suffering a Wound,
or automatically during a full moon. The trick is
returning to normal requires the beast to kill —
which may mean a Corruption test. The victim
killed may be an animal or an opponent, the curse
isn’t particular. Reverting back to normal isn’t
immediate; the werewolf chooses when to change,
which also triggers the Corruption test.
The curse is transmitted by attacks. Lore proposes
that anyone severely injured by a werewolf who
survives might become cursed, but in actuality it’s
only those special cases who are slain but rise again
under the power of the curse — appearing to have
survived the attack when really they did not.
Allergies: Silver weapons and bullets deal +4
damage to lycanthropes. In addition, Wounds
caused by silver don’t heal from the Regeneration
ability below. Allergies apply whether the werewolf
is in normal or beast form.
Bite/Claws: In beast form only, the werewolf gains
a Bite/Claws attack that deals Strength+2 damage.
Regeneration: All Wounds and injuries
automatically heal at the end of each scene—even
death! Wounds caused by silver weapons only
heal at the normal rate. Death caused by a silver
weapon is permanent, and is death if such an
attack is delivered after the werewolf is Defeated
as a Coup de Gras. Regeneration applies to both
the lycanthrope’s forms.
Savagery: While in beast form only, the werewolf
gains a +2 bonus to Strength. If a target, friend or
foe, is within reach after movement the werewolf
must All-Out Attack, and the Friendly Fire rules
apply to melee attacks if multiple targets are within
reach. If any target is within the werewolf’s Move
he must end next to a target, but within those
constraints he can move however he desires.
If a failed Corruption test would eliminate the
character, he transforms completely into a beast
and never changes back. The beast may still
transmit the curse!
Werewolves are merely one strain of the curse.
Bats, tigers, and other creatures are possible."}

 "Most Orrorshan sorcerers skirt the edges of the
Abyss when they learn the arcane arts. Diabolists
jump right into the inferno, entreating with demons,
devils, and all manner of foul beings for additional
power. The representative for these powers is the
Diabolist’s imp.
Imps may be various beasts: cats, dogs, even
snakes! They are never bird or creatures of the air—
the dark powers of Orrorsh dwell below, not above.
Whatever the base creature is, it’s about half the size
of a human and always jet black. Imps are strong for
their size, but their most important characteristic is
they can speak — although most prefer not to draw
attention to themselves by doing so.
In game terms, the player should control the
imp most of the time, choosing its targets, rolling
its attacks, and speaking for it. Imps don’t have
knowledge beyond the sorcerer they are attached
to. They represent the dark powers, but don’t have
magic or powers of their own.
Imps do not have Possibilities, but the sorcerer
can spend his Possibilities (and Destiny cards) for
the creature — even if they are separated. If slain
the dark powers form a new beast to act as the
Diabolist’s imp. They aren’t pleased at having to
do so, and both they and the creature may find ways
to express this displeasure and spur the sorcerer to
employ more caution in the future.

tea for up to six people.
Serving tea usually is an elaborate
ritual, not all of which is necessarily
possible when in the dark jungles.
Afternoon tea must be done between
the hour of four and five o’clock
(spending a Possibility allows the
ritual to take place anytime, but
only once each day). After an hour
of serving tea, the tea master makes a
Charisma + scholar test. The guests may
assist as a Combined Action.
Tea and at least one “guest” are required
but if the tea master serves tea with dainty
sandwiches, scones, and pastries, the
test is Favored. If the participants dress
up in finery (at least semi-formal: day
dresses, frock coats, hats, and gloves)
the test is Up.
The benefit depends on the Success Level:
• Standard: The tea master and all guests draw
a Destiny card.
• Good: All guests draw a Destiny Card. The tea
master draws two cards, then chooses one of
them, and discards the other.
• Outstanding: As Good but the tea master
draws two cards and keeps both."}
