This requires five\ndays and consumes Value Level 15 worth of magic\nitems. Each +1 Value beyond 15 grants a +1 bonus\nto the test at the end of the process.\nWith the resources committed, the mage gives the\nspell a unique name, sets the appropriate magical\nskill, the minimum skill needed to cast the new\nspell, and the DN. The higher the DN and minimum\nskill, the more powerful the end result may be.\nThe caster designates the Magic Axiom for the\nspell, referencing the guidelines in Torg Eternity.

The more powerful options\nfor each category are the latter ones listed.
