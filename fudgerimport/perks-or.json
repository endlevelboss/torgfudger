Ghosts have powerful traits\nthat are treated like racial abilities:\nEthereal: Ghosts are spirits rather than flesh, and\nhave a hard time interacting with the physical\nworld.

Many pretend to walk. Ghosts\nignore penalties for terrain, but they cannot run.\nThey must have some kind of ground or surface\nto float atop\u2014although falling does no damage\nto a ghost.\nUncanny: There\u2019s something off-putting\nabout a ghost\u2019s appearance. It could be\nsubtle things like not breathing or\nblinking, or more overt like a twisted\nneck or feet. Whatever the cause,\nliving creatures (especially animals)\ninstinctively abhor a ghost.

Spirits\nare beings composed entirely\nof memories and emotions.\nWhen memories become\nmuddled \u2014 or emotions\ntoo strong \u2014 ghosts risk\nlosing themselves to rage or fear or\nrevenge.
